## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: All in-app panels render through shadcn-svelte primitives and Tailwind utility classes that consume semantic tokens

The system SHALL render every in-app panel (`Console`, `ThemePicker`, `SymbolPicker`, `SimplifyPanel`, `TracksPanel`, `WaypointsPanel`, `TrackPointsPanel`, `Sidebar`, `MapView` wrapper) through shadcn-svelte primitives — `Card`, `ScrollArea`, `Button`, `Select`, `Popover`, `Tooltip`, `Slider`, `Switch`, `Label`, `Separator`, `Dialog`, `Table`, `Tabs` — and SHALL style their static surfaces through Tailwind utility classes that read the semantic-token CSS variables (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-popover`, `border-border`, `bg-card`, `bg-muted`, …).

Component-local `<style>` blocks SHALL be removed, except where a rule expresses a dynamic value sourced from the domain (e.g. a `TrackStyle.color` swatch). Such dynamic values SHALL be expressed as inline `style=` attributes, not as Tailwind classes.

`MapView.svelte` SHALL be migrated at the wrapper level only; MapLibre initialization, source/layer setup, drag handlers, click handlers, and the tile-protocol code SHALL NOT be modified by this requirement.

`TracksPanel.svelte` and `WaypointsPanel.svelte` SHALL retain their native `<input type="color">` controls for track and waypoint colour selection. These controls SHALL operate on the RGBA domain values stored in `TrackStyle.color` (and the equivalent waypoint property) and SHALL NOT be bound to `--ctp-*` palette variables or to semantic-token CSS variables.

Toast notifications SHALL be routed through `svelte-sonner` mounted in the root layout, rather than ad-hoc `alert()` or inline error surfaces.

#### Scenario: Panel surfaces follow the active flavour

- **WHEN** the user switches the active Catppuccin flavour while any panel is open
- **THEN** the panel's static surfaces (background, foreground text, borders, dividers, hover states) re-render through the new flavour's semantic-token values without any `<style>`-block override

#### Scenario: Track colour swatch is independent of the theme switch

- **WHEN** the user assigns a track a specific colour (e.g. `#ff8800`) via the native `<input type="color">` in `TracksPanel`, then switches the Catppuccin flavour
- **THEN** the track's colour swatch and its MapLibre rendering remain exactly `#ff8800` across all four flavours; no `--ctp-*` or semantic-token variable rebinds the swatch

#### Scenario: All four flavours pass the visual smoke pass

- **WHEN** the maintainer captures screenshots of `Sidebar` + `MapView` + an open `TracksPanel` (with at least one track loaded) across all four Catppuccin flavours via `ozi-rs-mcp`
- **THEN** each flavour renders without missing styles, without leftover hard-coded colours that bypass semantic tokens, and without regressions to MapLibre map content

#### Scenario: MapView wrapper migrates without touching MapLibre internals

- **WHEN** the maintainer reviews the `MapView.svelte` migration commit
- **THEN** the diff modifies only the outer wrapper container's classes (Tailwind utilities) and any Tailwind-replaced wrapper styles; MapLibre `new maplibregl.Map(...)` construction, source/layer setup, drag handlers, click handlers, and the tile-protocol code SHALL be byte-identical to before the commit

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Backtick key toggles an in-app developer console

The system SHALL toggle visibility of an in-app developer console whenever the user presses the backtick (`` ` ``) key while the application has focus. The console SHALL render through the shadcn-svelte `Card` primitive with a `ScrollArea` body and a `Button` close affordance.

#### Scenario: Open and close console

- **WHEN** the user presses backtick once and then again
- **THEN** the developer console appears on the first press (rendered as a `Card` with theme-aware semantic-token surfaces) and disappears on the second
